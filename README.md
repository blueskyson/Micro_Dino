# Micro Dino

Micro Dino is the final project of *CSIE3009 - Microprocessor Principles and Applications* by [Wei-Ta Chu](https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/en/persons/wei-ta-chu) at National Cheng Kung University. This course aims to familiarize students with microcontroller hardware and architecture, as well as low-level Assembly/C language programming. In this project, we made a dino game and a car driving game implemented by PIC18F4520 microprocessor &amp; Unity. These games aim to bring joy to people while also encouraging them to do hand exercises.
